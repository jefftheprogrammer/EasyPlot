# EasyPlot
This program allows you to make detailed graphs by importing data from excel files. 

## Current Features
It can create a scatter plot.

## Features I would like to add:
* Customizable graphs
* The ability to import data from excel files
* Error bars
* Regression lines (linear and polynomial).
* Equation of line as y intercept
* well as residual graphs
* Different variables on a single graph
